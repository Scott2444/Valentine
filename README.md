# Valentine

A static webpage to ask my girlfriend to be my valentine. It will be a single page. It will start with I ask her to be my valentine with a Yes and No button. The joke is that the No button will avoid being clicked. The No button will first move away from the cursor to evade it. Eventually, if it has to evade too much, it will swap with Yes when No is pressed.

If she presses yes then it will show a happy cat gif.
